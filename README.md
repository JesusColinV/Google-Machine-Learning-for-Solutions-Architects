# Google Machine Learning and Generative AI for Solutions Architects

This repository provides support materials and examples for the [Google Machine Learning and Generative AI for Solutions Architects](https://a.co/d/6EC0G2U) book.

Each of the code examples in this repository are intended to accompany that book. Each top-level folder in this repository is associated with a chapter in the book. The chapter contents explain the concepts being represented in the notebooks. 
In many cases, the chapter contents outline prerequisite activities that need to be performed before running the code in the notebooks. Please ensure that you have read the relevant chapter sections before executing the code in these notebooks.

There are also some generic prerequisite steps outlined [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Google-Machine-Learning-for-Solutions-Architects/blob/main/Prerequisite-steps/Prerequisites.ipynb).
