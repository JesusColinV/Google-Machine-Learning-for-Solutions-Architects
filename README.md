## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
# Load dataset
data = load_wine()
df = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for aspiring solutions architects looking to design and implement AI/ML solutions on Google Cloud. Although this book is suitable for both beginners and experienced practitioners, basic knowledge of Python and ML concepts is required. The book focuses on how AI/ML is used in the real world on Google Cloud. It briefly covers the basics at the beginning to establish a baseline for you, but it does not go into depth on the underlying mathematical concepts that are readily available in academic material.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-18).
