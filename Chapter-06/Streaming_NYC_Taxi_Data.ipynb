    "This example demonstrates how to set up a streaming pipeline that processes a stream that contains NYC taxi ride data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a modified version of an example from Google's example repository, and it reads the data from a public Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic that Google created for people to be able to test streaming data processing use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element in the stream contains the location of the taxi, the timestamp, the meter reading, the meter increment, the passenger count, and ride status in JSON format.\n",

    "We will use Apache Beam to define the pipeline, run it on Google Cloud Dataflow, and store the results in Google Cloud BigQuery.\n",
